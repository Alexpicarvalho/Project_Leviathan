
How to Install Samples

  Samples are provided by pipeline. To import the samples please use the "Start Screen" to do so instead of 
  unpacking manually, this will ensure that they are imported correctly:

  Go to Windows > Amplify Impostors > Start Screen and under "Samples" select the ones you wish to import. 
  Do be aware that importing any SRP samples requires to first install the respective pipeline using the 
  package manager.
